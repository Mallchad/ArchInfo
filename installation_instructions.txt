Verify the boot mode. BIOS|UEFI
-------------------------------
#ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
If the directory does not exist the system may be booted in BIOS mode

Connecting to the internet
---------------------------
Ensure your network interface is lsited and enabled
#ip link
Connect to the network by plugging in an ethernet cable
If you are using wireless you need to connect with wireless manager

Paritioning the disks
----------------------------
Verify partitions and devices that you want to use
# lsblk
or
# fdisk -l
Results ending in rom, loop, and airroot should be ignored as they 
are part of the installation media
You need minimum one root partition for the main mount point of the
system and if UEFI is enable an EFI system partition
A BIOS specific partition is not neccecary but 2M is recommended
A swap patition is not neccecary recommended
Suggested Sizes
EFI 256-512 MiB
SWAP 512 MiB
root Remainder of the device
# cfdisk /dev/<device>

Format the partitions
---------------------
Format the root partition as ext4 filesystem
This is the recommended filesystem for normal linux installations
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/<root_partition>
Format the swap partition
# mkswap /dev/<swap_partition>
Format the EFI boot partiton if you have one
# mkfs.fat /dev/<boot_partition>

Mount the partitions
--------------------
Mount the root pratition
# mount /dev/<root_partition> /mnt
If you have an EFI system mount it
# mount /dev/<boot_partition> /mnt/boot
Initialize swap partition
#swapon /dev/<swap_partition>

Installation
-------------
You may want to maximize download speed from Arch mirrors to
make the installation as painless as possible
The mirror is found at /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
Move the most geographically closest mirror to the top to 
increaes its pritority in usage by pacman
this is temproary as it is written to the installation media
Install the base and extra base-devel package groups to root
# pacstrap /mnt base base-devel

Configure the system
--------------------
Generate fstab to auto-mount partitions based on current
mountings
# genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
Change the root to the newly created system
# arch-chroot /mnt
Here you may want to install a text editor based on tastes
# pacman -S emacs
# pacman -S vim
Set the time zome to respective
# lf -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/<Region>/<City> /etc/localtime
Generate adjtime
#hwclock --systohc
Language Localization, for American English open locale with
a text editor and uncomment
en_US.UTF-8
UTF-8
# emacs /etc/locale.gen
# locale-gen
Create locale and set the language accordingly
# LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf

Network configuration
----------------------
Create a hostname file and set a hostname
<hostname> > /etc/hostname

Root password
-------------
Set the root password
passwd

GRUB
-----------
Install grub
# pacman -S grub
For BIOS just install it straight to the device. not the 
partition, the device itself
# grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/<boot_device>
For UEFI install efibootmgr as well, os-prober may be of use
if you intend to have multiple operating systems on the hard 
drive, many do so you might as well install it
# pacman -S efibootmgr
Think of a name you want to see in the UEFI settings for
boot devices. Then install grub
# grub-install --target=x86-efi --efi-directory=/boot -- bootlaoder-id=<bootloader_name>
Generate the grub configuration file this will search for
other operating systems if you have os-prober installed
these have to be mounted to be detected
# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
Reboot
------
Exit the chroot enviorment
Ctrl-D
or
# exit
Reboot the system
# reboot
Login with root on login if all goes well
You should now have a working system, however very barebones

Xorg
----
Install xorg-server
xorg-apps may be neccecary
For both xorg-server and xorg-apps plus fonts just
install xorg
# pacman -S xorg

You probably want to have GPU acceleration so first
identify the card on your system then install the 
appropriate drivers
#pacman -S
NVidia 		xf86-video-nouveau		//open-source supports NVidia optimus
		mesa
		lib32-mesa
Proprietary	nvidia		
		nvidia-utils
		lib32-nvidia-utils		//Stable
Legacy		nvidia-390xx
		nvidia-390xx-utils
		lib32-nvidia-390xx-utils	//Legacy
AMD		xf86-video-amdgpu
		xf86-video-ati
		mesa
		lib32-mesa
Intel		xf86-video-intel
		mesa
		lib32-mesa
Install xorg-xinit
# pacman -S xorg-xinit
Copy the default init file to your home
cp /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc ~/.xinitrc

KDE Plasma
-----------
Install relavant packages.
plasma			//default installation
plasma-meta		//Dependency free installation
plasma-desktop		//Minimal installation
kde-applications	//Full kde applications
kde-applications-meta	//kde applications dependency free
# pacman -S
To start Plasma you need to use Xorg xinit/startx
Append exec startkde to your .xinitrc found in your home folder
# exec startide >> ~/.xinitrc
Run Xorg as a regular user
# startx

Users
-----
# useradd -m -G <additional_groups> -s /bin/bash <username>
