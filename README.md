# ArchInfo  
This is a personal installation guide to aid with the fresh installation   
of Arch Linux.   
I do not recommend following this if you do not know me   
personally, however you are of course free to do so if you wish.   
This guide   
is not actively maintained so it will not always be up to date, check the   
date of the latest commit to see if it's worth using  

See arch-installation.org for the main guide
